## Data 

The Brazilian government publishes open data data on the number of forest fires per state, per year. The latest dataset covers a period of approximately 10 years (1998 to 2017). With this data, it is possible to assess the evolution of fires over the years as well as the regions where they were concentrated.
For the purpose of this tutorial, we will focus on the subset of states comprising the Amazon forest: Acre, Amapá, Pará, Amazonas, Rondonia, Roraima, and part of Mato Grosso, Tocantins, and Maranhão.
